## Phase

Slice 0 (skeleton) is done: `docker compose up` starts `db`, `migrate`, `api` and `web`,
and the SPA shows the API health check that reached PostgreSQL. Next is slice 1
(catalogue and product page), full pipeline starting with `planner`.

## Decided

- Backend: NestJS (TypeScript)
- Frontend: separate React SPA talking to the API
- Workflow: planner → tdd-guide → implementation → reviewers, semi-auto
- Guest checkout, no parent account (ADR 001)
- Course = subject + year range; parent picks the year at purchase (ADR 002)
- Order = list of student seats, one course each; UI sends one seat (ADR 003)
- Student record is created at onboarding (ADR 004)
- Purchase outcome is a link plus an activation code; the code adds a course to an
  existing account; duplicates are rejected and the code stays valid (ADR 005)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma; migrations and seed in a separate compose service (ADR 006)
- Student logs in with a username (ADR 007)
- JWT in an httpOnly cookie; `scrypt` password hashing (ADR 008)
- Activation code: 15 characters, hashed at rest, single use, no expiry (ADR 009)
- Mock checkout: one request, always approved, no card fields (ADR 010)
- npm workspaces: `api/`, `web/`, types-only `packages/contracts/`; compose services `db`, `migrate`, `api`, `web` (ADR 011)
- Modular monolith on NestJS with five modules, no Java service (ADR 012)
- Tests: Jest + Testcontainers for the API, Vitest + RTL for the SPA (ADR 013)
- SPA tooling: Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind, React Hook Form (ADR 014)
- Toolchain: NestJS 11, Prisma 7.10.0, TypeScript 5.9.3 (ADR 015)
